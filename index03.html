    <section class="introduction">
      <p>Our goal for your care is to achieve results quickly. We work with you to achieve better health in six steps:</p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>At the first appointment, we talk about your overall health, lifestyle and the history of your symptoms.</p>
      <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
      <p>At the first appointment, we talk about your overall health, lifestyle and the history of your symptoms.</p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>We fully explain the nature of our diagnosis and present our plan for your recovery.</p>      
      <h3>Treatment</h3>
      <p>Your individual treatment plan will likely combine acupuncture with other modalities such as herbal formulas, dietary therapy, electric stimulation, bodywork or lifestyle counseling to help you heal without drugs or surgery.</p>
      <h3>At Home Care</h3>
      <p>Lifestyle changes are vital to the program. We help you find ways to continue to heal at home.</p>
      <h3>Re-evaluation</h3>
      <p>We check your progress at every appointment and make changes to your treatment plan as needed.</p>
      <h3>What sets us apart</h3>
      <p>We check your progress at every appointment and make changes to your treatment plan as needed.</p>
      <p>Each practitioner sees only one patient at a time.  This means that your session is deliberate and focused on you.</p>
      <p>We spend the time necessary to help you heal. Initial appointments are 1 1/2 hours, and follow-up appointments last an hour.</p>
      <p>Along with acupuncture, other healing treatments may include cupping, heat therapy, nutritional and lifestyle counseling, and body work at no additional charge.</p>
      <p>The herbs in our pharmacy are GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) certified; they are safe and effective.</p>
      <p>Together, we combine more than 40 years of experience in health promotion and an understanding of the powerful and effective healing art that is Chinese medicine.</p>
      <p>We are Nationally Board certified and licensed in Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Therapies. In addition, we are credentialed in and offer the Mei Zen system of Cosmetic Acupuncture.</p>
      <p>You are treated in a comfortable, safe, and professional environment.</p>
